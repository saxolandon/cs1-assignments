# Assignment 0: Found in the Shuffle (Strings)

An ordinary deck of playing cards contains 52 cards, each of which has a suit and a value. Most
card games require that a deck be shuffled at the beginning of a play. However, sometimes the
deck isn't shuffled well enough, and there are arrangements of cards in the deck which may cause
a bias in the play. Two such arrangements are a same-suit sequence and an ascending sequence.
A same-suit sequence is simply a sequence of consecutive cards in the deck with the same suit. An
ascending sequence is a sequence of consecutive cards in the deck that follow one another in
increasing value, with Ace following King and preceding two. Thus, 2S, 5S, KS, 3S AS is a samesuit sequence of length five, and 9C, 10D, JC, QS, KH, AC, 2D is an ascending sequence of length
seven, and 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H is both a same-suit and ascending sequence of length five.

## The Problem
Given a deck of cards, determine the length of the longest same-suit sequence and the length of
the longest ascending sequence.

## The Input (to be read from standard input)
The first line will contain a single positive integer, c (c â‰¤ 25), representing the number of test cases
to process. The test cases follow.

Each test case will be two lines long, each line will contain a string of 52 characters. The first line
represents the first 26 cards in the deck and the second line represents the next 26 cards, in order
in the deck.

Each card will be represented with two characters, one for its kind and one for its suit, in that order.
The 13 characters representing kinds are '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A', in ascending
order. The 4 characters representing suits are 'C', 'D', 'H' and 'S'.

## The Output (to be printed to standard out)

For each input case, output two space separated integers on a line by themselves: the length of the
longest same-suit sequence and the length of the longest ascending sequence, respectively.

### Implementation Restrictions/ Run-Time/Memory Restrictions
1. You must read the deck for each case into statically allocated string(s).
2. For full credit, your algorithm must run in O(n) time. This means that you can only do a few
separate single loops through a deck of cards for full credit. In particular a correct solution that
has a pair of nested loops will NOT receive full credit.
3. For full credit, you must have appropriately designed functions. In particular, any correct
solution which is fully coded in main will NOT receive full credit.
3. You must only declare your string variables INSIDE your case loop.
